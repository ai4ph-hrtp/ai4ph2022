This online tutorial will accompany two sessions: Tutorial on text analytics with R Data Challenge using the N2C2 NLP Research Datasets 1.1 Before the sessions Install R and RStudio Create a new R Project in RStudio(via File -&gt; New Projects) Install required R packages Access the Twitter Data for the tutorial session Github Link 1.1.1 Install Required R Packages Run the code below to install and load the required packages. # specify the packages to install or load in a vector packages &lt;- c(&quot;tidytext&quot;,&quot;tidyverse&quot;,&quot;tidymodels&quot;,&quot;scales&quot;, &quot;quanteda&quot;,&quot;SnowballC&quot;,&quot;topicmodels&quot;,&quot;textrecipes&quot;, &quot;vip&quot;,&quot;stopwords&quot;,&quot;themis&quot;,&quot;discrim&quot;,&quot;naivebayes&quot;, &quot;LiblineaR&quot;,&quot;tidyr&quot;,&quot;XML&quot;,&quot;xml2&quot;,&quot;readr&quot;) # Loop through each package for (package in packages) { # if not installed, then install. if (!require(package, character.only = TRUE)) { install.packages(package, dependencies = TRUE, repos=&#39;http://cran.us.r-project.org&#39;) } } for (package in packages){ # load the required packages library(package, character.only = TRUE) } # print the list of libraries that are loaded (.packages()) 1.1.2 Twitter Dataset for the Tutorial The dataset can be found in the Github Repo Click the URLs to obtain the twitter data sets in csv files from Github. Dataset for Classification: sampleTwitterDataForClassification.csv Dataset for Topic Modelling: sampleTwitterDataForTopicModelling.csv If you want to save the data on your local machine (optional), right-click then Save as We will use the URLs to access the Twitter data directly. 1.1.2.1 Twitter Dataset for Classification The dataset is a sample of annotated twitter data with the goal to infer recent plausible COVID-19 cases. The data structure: Each column is a variable Each row is an observation (e.g.Â tweet, annotation) Variables included: X: tweet_id tweet: the tweet contents annotation: 1: Yes (plausible COVID-19 cases) 0: No or Unsure 1.1.2.2 Twitter Dataset for Topic Modelling The dataset is a collection of tweets related to COVID-19, it has only one column tweet.
